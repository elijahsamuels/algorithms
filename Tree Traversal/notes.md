# Tree Traversal (Binary trees)
- What is a tree?
- A data structure that organizes data in a hierarchical form

## Breadth First Search (BFS) (aka Level Order Traversal)

### Conceptually, what is it?
 - This method traverses a tree, starting with the root, and visits each node within a level before preceding to the next level.

- Recursive
- Iterative

## Depth First Search (DFS)

### Conceptually, what is it?
 - This method traverses a tree, visits the furthest node before backtracking up the branch.
