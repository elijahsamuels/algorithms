Root: top most node in a tree
Node/Vertex: structure that contains a value
Leaf: node without any child nodes
Edge: connection between two nodes
Path: sequence of nodes and edges that connect two nodes
Distance: number of edges between two nodes
Parent/Child: two directly connected nodes (parent node is above child node)
Ancestor/Descendant: two nodes that are connected by multipled parent-child paths

Parent: has one or more nodes that are children
Child: has a parent node directly above it
Sibling: two adjacent nodes with the same parent
Ancestor: the node that is two levels (or more) above a child
Descendant: the node that is two levels (or more) below an ancestor

Degree: number of child nodes of a given node
Level: distance between a node and the ROOT node
Depth: maximum level in tree (vertical space)
Breadth: number of leaves in a tree (horizontal space)
Size: total number of nodes
